# Amazon_Review-Senitment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the automated process of understanding the sentiment or opinion of a given text. The following Machine Learning model can provide insights by automatically analyzing product reviews and separating them into tags: Positive, Negative. By using sentiment analysis to structure product reviews, you could understand what your customers like and dislike about your product, compare your product reviews with those of your competitors, etc. 

Here we will accomplish the project by using Natural Language Processing in python. There are few steps thatâ€™ll be unambiguously followed in the process to obtain the output like Data Extraction, Data Wrangling, Data Pre-processing, Data Visualization, Feature Engineering, etc, for accurate results.

Here we used statistical ML model as well as Recurrent Neural Network model to predict the sentiment of the reviews.
